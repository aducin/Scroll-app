Scroll-app is a demo app that uses infinite scroll functionality.

Project has been developed using React (React Hooks) and TypeScript.
Server-side data has been mocked using Json-server and Json-schema-faker.

To run the project clone the repo locally and install project`s dependencies using "npm install" command.
A default file with mocked data (db.json) has been attached to the project.
Alternatively it is possible to generate a different data using Json-schema-faker (faker.json file includes a data schema):
https://json-schema-faker.js.org/

To enable Json-server run "json-server --watch db.json --port 8000".
Then open the app with "npm start" command.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
